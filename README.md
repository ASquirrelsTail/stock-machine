## About

Stock Machine is a game made for [The PNGE Jam #03](https://itch.io/jam/pnge03) based on the theme of "Money" using only [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript library based on the Processing language.

It was the only entry at the end of the jam, so it must have won. Some guy liked it so much he left a two star rating.

A playable version of the game can be found on [itch.io](https://asquirrelstail.itch.io/stock-machine).
